  description: (<h3>After piloting in 2014, Chapeltown Arts Festival is back for the third year; making its mark on promoting and encouraging the arts and creativity in the Chapeltown area in north-east Leeds.<br/><br/>Being a charity funded organisation they approached our university inviting us to redesign the promotional material for the week-long creative extravaganza.<br/><br/>The client requested a solution that was cost-effective and that could serve as a souvenir of the event as a way of not wasting paper. I created a pair of leaflets where you can read, cut & stick your way to building your very own kirigami pencil or ghettoblaster model, as a way of promoting the creative philosophy and Afro-Jamaican roots of the festival.<br/><br/>The experimental design of the leaflet invited the public to get involved in the festival in a crafty, whimsical way. Using an A5 layout and a single colour format kept costs low and allowed the option of using different coloured paper to print on; as a way of connecting with the diverse area of Chapeltown.</h3>),
