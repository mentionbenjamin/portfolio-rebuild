    <h3>
      After piloting in 2014, Chapeltown Arts Festival is back for the third year; making its mark on promoting and encouraging the arts and creativity in the Chapeltown area in north-east Leeds.
      <br/><br/>
      The client requested a solution that was cost-effective and one that could serve as a souvenir of the event as a way of not wasting paper. By creating a pair of leaflets the user can read, cut & stick their way to building their very own kirigami pencil or ghettoblaster model as a way of promoting the creative philosophy and Afro-Jamaican roots of the festival.
      <br/><br/>
      The experimental design of the leaflet invited the public to get involved in the festival in a crafty, whimsical way. By using an A5 layout and a single colour format kept costs low and allowed the option of using different coloured paper to print on as a way of connecting with the diverse area of Chapeltown.
