  description: (<h3>As a way to kickstart final year, we had two weeks to interpret three graffiti tags as brand or corporate logosâ€”here is part one of three. Due to the experimental nature of the brief, the aim was to have a bit of fun whilst exploring how to get the public involved in idea generation.<br/><br/>The outcome proved to be an enlightening experiment exploring the manipulation of a single character face; introducing me to new ideas for communicating the personality of a brand.
  Inviting passers-by to express themselves through pen to paper proved to be an insightful experiment. In a way, it gave back to the public and humanised the way in which a consumer can connect with a brand.</h3>),
